Aegis-Grid v4.0
===============

Scope:
Cyber-physical validation with microgrid dynamics.

Focus:
- Control room + substation microgrids
- Frequency / voltage / stability coupling
- Communication-layer attacks
- Replay and delay effects
- Agent vs non-agent baseline comparison

Outcome:
Demonstrates that agentic, multi-layer defense
preserves physical stability under coordinated attacks.

Status:
Current research version.
