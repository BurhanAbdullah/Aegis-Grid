🔒 A Research Framework for Fail-Secure, Agent-Based  
Communication in Cyber-Physical Power Systems




📘 1. Motivation and Context
──────────────────────────

Aegis-Grid exists because most contemporary security models for
cyber-physical power systems implicitly assume conditions that do not
hold in practice.

In particular, they often assume that communication failures degrade
gracefully, that delayed data can be safely reused, or that security
mechanisms can be layered independently of physical system behavior.

This framework is built on the opposite assumption.

In safety-critical cyber-physical systems, communication that violates
its constraints is not merely suboptimal. It is actively dangerous.

Aegis-Grid therefore adopts a fail-secure stance from the outset.
Messages are either delivered correctly within declared constraints,
or they are explicitly invalidated. There is no attempt to salvage,
approximate, or reinterpret late or malformed information.

This choice is not made for performance reasons. It is made to preserve
physical safety and analytical clarity.




📕 2. Conceptual Overview
───────────────────────

At a high level, Aegis-Grid can be understood as an exploration of one
question:

What does secure communication look like when correctness is defined by
physical system safety rather than network reliability?

To answer this, the framework models communication not as a transport
problem, but as a constrained decision process embedded within a
cyber-physical system.

Each message is evaluated against a set of explicit criteria:

⏱️ timing validity  
📐 structural correctness  
🔐 trust assumptions  
⚡ physical safety relevance  

If any of these criteria are violated, the message is rejected, even if
it could technically be delivered.

This approach intentionally sacrifices availability in favor of
predictability and safety.




🧠 3. Design Philosophy and Research Stance
─────────────────────────────────────────

Aegis-Grid is intentionally conservative in its claims and aggressive
in its assumptions.

It does not attempt to demonstrate superior throughput, latency, or
scalability. Instead, it attempts to make failure modes explicit and
auditable.

Several guiding principles shape the framework.

🔐 Fail-Secure First  
Security mechanisms are evaluated by how they fail, not how they
perform under ideal conditions.

📐 Explicitness Over Convenience  
All assumptions are declared. Hidden defaults are treated as design
errors.

⚙️ Physical Correctness Over Network Correctness  
A message that is correct at the network layer but harmful to the
physical system is considered invalid.

🧩 Separation of Research Questions  
Each version isolates a specific question. Complexity is introduced
deliberately, not accumulated accidentally.

🔍 Reproducibility as a Primary Goal  
Results are intended to be inspected, questioned, and reproduced, not
optimized or marketed.




🗂️ 4. Versioned Research Structure
────────────────────────────────

The framework is organized as a sequence of research stages.
These stages are not upgrades, patches, or releases.

They are deliberately independent viewpoints on the same core problem.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🟢 v1 — Baseline Fail-Secure Communication
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Version 1 establishes the minimal semantics required for fail-secure
communication.

It focuses on correctness under fragmentation, reassembly, and strict
acceptance rules.

No adaptation is permitted. No learning occurs. Every decision is
deterministic and traceable.

This version exists to answer a simple question:

What does the simplest possible fail-secure communication model look
like when all ambiguity is removed?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🟡 v2 — Adaptive Thresholding Under Pressure
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Version 2 introduces sustained adversarial conditions.

Rather than modeling isolated failures, this version examines what
happens when pressure is applied continuously over time.

Thresholds are allowed to adapt, but adaptation itself is constrained.
Unbounded flexibility is treated as a liability rather than a strength.

The goal is to study whether correctness can be preserved when the
system is forced to operate near its limits.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🟠 v3 — Agent-Based Autonomous Security
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Version 3 introduces autonomous security agents.

These agents make local decisions without access to a global oracle.
Coordination is limited, and disagreement is possible.

This version does not assume that autonomy improves outcomes. Instead,
it treats autonomy as a source of new failure modes that must be
understood.

The focus is on how local decision-making interacts with global system
safety.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🟣 v3.3 — Extended Cyber-Physical Timing
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Version 3.3 tightens the coupling between communication and physical
timing constraints.

Messages are evaluated not only by their content but by their arrival
relative to physical deadlines.

Late information is not degraded or flagged. It is invalidated.

This version exists to test whether security logic remains coherent when
physical time becomes the dominant constraint.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔵 v4 — Grid-Aware Security Constraints
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Version 4 explicitly incorporates grid state into security decisions.

Security policies are no longer generic. They are derived from safety
constraints of the power system itself.

This version does not claim to improve security. It claims to reduce
misalignment between security decisions and physical safety.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚫ v5 — Conceptual Post-Cryptographic Model
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Version 5 is intentionally conceptual.

It explores what remains of a fail-secure architecture when traditional
cryptographic assumptions are weakened or removed.

This version makes no implementation claims. Its purpose is to stress
test architectural assumptions rather than propose solutions.


📊 5. Model-Level Comparison
──────────────────────────

A structured qualitative comparison across all versions is provided in
the accompanying documentation.

This comparison avoids plots, metrics, and numerical rankings.

Instead, it focuses on:

📎 declared assumptions  
📎 threat models  
📎 decision boundaries  
📎 failure semantics  

The intent is to clarify trade-offs, not to claim superiority.




🔎 6. Reproducibility and Methodological Rigor
────────────────────────────────────────────

Reproducibility is treated as a first-class requirement.

All figures are generated directly from analytical expressions or raw
simulation outputs.

No data points are removed.
No smoothing or curve fitting is applied.
No undocumented transformations are performed.

Parameters are explicitly stated and version-scoped.

The repository includes scripts and documentation sufficient to trace
each result back to its origin.




🎯 7. Intended Audience and Use
─────────────────────────────

This repository is intended for readers who are interested in:

🎓 architectural reasoning  
🧪 methodological comparison  
🔍 inspection of assumptions  
🏗️ cyber-physical system security  

It is not intended as a drop-in solution, reference implementation, or
deployment artifact.

Using it as such would be a category error.




⚠️ 8. Scope and Responsibility Disclaimer
────────────────────────────────────────

Aegis-Grid is a research framework.

Some mechanisms are abstracted.
Some components are analytical rather than executable.

Results are provided for inspection, reproducibility, and academic
discussion only.

No claim is made regarding operational suitability, regulatory
compliance, or deployment safety.
