Aegis-Grid v4.0 — Cyber-Physical Extension

Status: Experimental (Runnable)

This version extends Aegis-Grid into the cyber-physical domain by modeling
threshold-triggered control responses under rising system stress.

It is NOT part of the main paper results.
It exists to demonstrate forward compatibility with physical-layer semantics.

The simulation is deterministic, dependency-safe, and audit-friendly.
