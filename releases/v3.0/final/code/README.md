# Aegis-Grid v3 — Agentic Security Architecture

Version 3 introduces autonomous security agents.

Security behavior is modeled as a closed-loop control system, where
agents observe network conditions and adjust behavior in real time.

## Security Model

- Sender and receiver agents
- Autonomous accept / reject decisions
- No static security configuration
- Control-theoretic security logic

## Threat Model

- Adaptive adversary
- Timing manipulation
- Partial interception

## Achievements

- Demonstrated agent-based security control
- Removed static policy dependence
- Enabled autonomous fail-secure decisions

Status: Stable research architecture.
