Threat Model – V5 (Unbounded Quantum Adversary)

Adversary Capabilities:
- Unlimited classical computation
- Unlimited quantum computation
- Perfect packet capture and storage
- Arbitrary offline cryptanalysis
- Packet delay, drop, reorder, injection
- Endpoint compromise after transmission

Non-Assumptions:
- No cryptographic hardness assumptions
- No long-term secret confidentiality
- No reliance on post-quantum complexity

Security Goals:
- Time-bounded information-theoretic confidentiality
- Irreversible cryptographic erasure
- All-or-nothing reconstruction
- Post-expiry futility of analysis
- Traffic-level statistical indistinguishability

Explicitly Not Claimed:
- Eternal secrecy
- Unbreakable encryption
- DoS resistance
