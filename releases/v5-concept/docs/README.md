# Aegis-Grid v5 — Conceptual Post-Cryptographic Model

Version 5 explores security beyond computational assumptions.

This version assumes an adversary with quantum capabilities and
unbounded computational resources.

## Security Model

- No reliance on computational hardness
- Information-theoretic framing
- Semantic security over secrecy

## Threat Model

- Full protocol knowledge
- Unlimited compute
- Long-term interception

## Scope

This version is conceptual only.
It defines threat boundaries and security goals.
No implementation claims are made.

Status: Conceptual research release.
