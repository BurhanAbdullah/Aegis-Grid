# Aegis-Grid v2 — Adaptive Fail-Secure Security

Version 2 extends the baseline model by introducing adaptation.

Security parameters respond dynamically to observed attack pressure,
rather than remaining fixed.

## Security Model

- Adaptive (n, k) reconstruction thresholds
- Continuous monitoring of delivery success
- Automatic transition to fail-secure shutdown

## Threat Model

- Sustained packet dropping
- Long-duration degradation attacks
- No need for packet inspection by adversary

## Achievements

- Demonstrated adaptive defense under stress
- Formalized irreversible fail-secure states
- Showed resilience against prolonged attack

Status: Stable and frozen.
