Aegis-Grid v2.0
===============

Scope:
Secure baseline architecture (pre-agentic).

Focus:
- Hardened communication logic
- Time-bounded and PQ-aware design
- Improved threat modeling
- Structural security guarantees

Notes:
Core logic was intentionally abstracted / protected.
This version represents architectural maturity, not adaptivity.

Status:
Locked. Architecture reference.
