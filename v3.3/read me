Aegis Grid – Experimental Release v3.3

This directory contains the frozen experimental evaluation of the Aegis Grid
secure communication architecture. Version 3.3 corresponds exactly to the
results reported in the paper and is intended for reproducibility, review,
and archival purposes.

This version is tagged and should be treated as read-only. Later development
versions may extend or modify the system, but all experimental claims in the
paper are derived from this release.

Overview

The experiments in this directory evaluate a time-bounded, fail-secure
communication model integrated with IEEE benchmark power systems. Power-flow
behavior is modeled using pandapower, while network delay, packet loss, and
temporal validity constraints are explicitly simulated.

The focus of this release is not controller performance, but the interaction
between real-time constraints, adversarial delay, and fail-secure semantics
in cyber-physical power system communication.

Directory Layout

scripts contains bash scripts used to run all experiments.
results contains CSV files generated directly by the experiments.
docs contains LaTeX-ready tables derived from the CSV results.
plots is reserved for optional figures.

All results in the docs directory are generated from the CSV files in results.
No numbers are hard-coded.

Reproducing the Experiments

From the repository root, run:

cd v3.3

./scripts/sweep_delay_v3_3.sh
./scripts/compare_baseline_v3_3.sh
./scripts/ieee39_test_v3_3.sh

These scripts generate CSV outputs in the results directory.

To generate the paper table:

./scripts/generate_table_v3_3.sh > docs/results_table_v3_3.tex

The generated LaTeX file can be included directly in the paper without
modification.

Experimental Content

The delay sweep experiment evaluates acceptance probability as a function of
network delay under a fixed message validity window using t
