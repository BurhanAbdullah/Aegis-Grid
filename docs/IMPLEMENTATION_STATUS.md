Implementation Status Clarification

This repository contains both executable simulation artifacts and
conceptual or analytical models.

Implemented and Executable:
- v1.0.0 baseline fail-secure simulation
- v2.0 irreversible time-lock model
- v3.x agent-mediated security control (locked + agentic)
- v4.0 cyber-physical safety coupling (safe fallback execution)

Conceptual / Analytical Only:
- v5 (post-cryptographic, quantum-adversarial semantics)

Baseline comparisons against IEC 62351, encrypted-only traffic, and
IDS-based security are analytical and model-based.
No experimental claims are made for third-party systems.

This distinction is intentional and documented to preserve academic rigor.
