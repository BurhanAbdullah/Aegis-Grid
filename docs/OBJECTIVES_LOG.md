# AEGIS-GRID Objectives Matrix

## Pillar 1 — Availability
- Adaptive quorum threshold based on packet loss
- Minimum reconstruction threshold enforced

## Pillar 2 — Security
- Forgery detection via per-fragment signatures
- Attack pressure accumulation
- Irreversible time-lock on sustained attack

## Pillar 3 — Identity & Trust
- RSA-2048 root of trust
- Verified node authentication
- Layer-separated key derivation

## Safety Invariants
- Time-lock is irreversible
- Quorum cannot drop below safety floor
- Identity verification precedes traffic acceptance
