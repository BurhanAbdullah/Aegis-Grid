# Figure Provenance and Reproducibility Statement

All figures in the Aegis-Grid repository are generated directly from
analytical expressions or raw simulation outputs.

The following guarantees apply to all reported results:

- No data points are removed
- No smoothing or curve fitting is applied
- Parameters are stated explicitly in figure captions or associated scripts
- Code used to generate each figure is included in the `/scripts` directory

Analytical figures are evaluated directly from closed-form expressions
derived in the manuscript. Simulation figures report direct metric outputs
from executed models without post-processing manipulation.

This ensures full reproducibility, auditability, and reviewer inspection.
