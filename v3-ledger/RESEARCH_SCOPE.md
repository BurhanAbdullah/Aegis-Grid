Status: ACTIVE (Research Track)
Initialized: 2026-02-06T06:08:56Z

Scope:
- Hybrid off-chain communication with on-chain verification
- Blockchain used ONLY for identity, commitments, and revocation
- No payloads, messages, or control data on-chain

Non-Goals:
- Performance optimisation
- Deployment readiness
- Public blockchain dependency

This track exists to answer one question:

Can fail-secure, agent-based communication gain *audit-grade integrity*
without sacrificing real-time safety?
